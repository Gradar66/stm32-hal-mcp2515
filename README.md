CAN-BUS is a common industrial bus because of its long travel distance, medium communication speed and high reliability. It is commonly found on modern machine tools and as an automotive diagnostic bus. This CAN-BUS Shield gives your Arduino/Seeeduino CAN-BUS capability. With an OBD-II converter cable added on and the OBD-II library imported, you are ready to build an onboard diagnostic device or data logger.

* Implements CAN V2.0B at up to 1 Mb/s
* SPI Interface up to 10 MHz
* Standard (11 bit) and extended (29 bit) data and remote frames
* Two receive buffers with prioritized message storage
